## Scrape the pages or use the existing markdown?

Q: Use the existing markdown or scrape the pages? A: Scrape the pages.

Rationale:

- Puts in place the mechanism required to keeping the content up to date, when the content changes and isn't available
  in the existing GitHub repo.
- The existing markdown would have required some processing so that step exists either way.
- Link to page from where content originated is known with scraping whereas using existing markdown would require
  generating and potential for errors.
